                        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Keiana Hanson, but a lot of people just call me
                        "Kiki." 
                        In 2016, I graduated from Binghamton University with my Bachelor of Arts with a major in
                        Creative Writing and a minor in Cinema. As a child, I’ve always been creative – from
                        writing “fanfictions” about my favorite characters from movies and shows, to creating
                        ridiculous skits and short movies with my college a capella group, 
                        I’ve always wanted to be creative for a living. </p>
                        <p>
                            I came across a non-profit group called
                            Woman Who Code, and it changed my life. Seeing so many women of diverse backgrounds
                            inspired me to pursue coding. I enrolled in Columbia University’s Fullstack Coding Boot Camp 
                            so I may develop the skill set to become a software developer 
                            and bring my ideas to light in the medium of
                            video games. </p>
                        <p> This post-grad journey has been confusing, and I’ve had many moments where I
                        felt lost, but I am forever grateful for the journey nonetheless, as it has led me to
                        this point in my life, and I’m excited to see where I end up. </p>
                            <p> Since graduating from my bootcamp in 2020, I've fallen in love with being a Developer Support Engineers for start-ups 
                            and venturing out to tech conferences all over where I can meet new people in the industry. </p>
